## The autoresponse
### :us:
```
Thanks so much for reaching out. It makes me really happy to see that my profile caught your attention! 

As a curious person myself, I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. However, as a Software Engineer, I'm sure you can imagine that I receive a lot of offers here at LinkedIn.

While I would really like to, I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. Frequently, incoming proposals happen to have a poor fit.

That being said, I would love to know more about your opportunity and understand the seniority level you're looking for.

Could you send me the company name, the job description and, total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to? I want to have this information so I can make best with our precious time by making sure the oportunity is strongly aligned with my curent career moment.

Thanks once again for reaching out, I'll be waiting for the details requested to continue our conversation. Looking forward to hearing from you!

João

Fico muito feliz pelo seu contato e que o meu perfil chamou a sua atenção!

Por ser uma pessoa curiosa, eu estou sempre interessado nas oportunidades que surgem. Todavia, como Engenheiro de Software, você deve imaginar que recebo ofertas frequentemente aqui no LinkedIn.

Eu gostaria muito, porém não possuo a disponibilidade de entrar em call para discutir todas oportunidades recebidas e, frequentemente, algumas delas acabam não tendo um bom fit. 

Dito isso, eu adoraria saber mais sobre a sua oportunidade e entender o nível de senioridade que você está buscando.

Podes me mandar o nome da empresa, uma descrição detalhada da vaga e a compensação total da posição que você está tentando preencher? Faço questão de ter essas informações para que eu possa fazer o melhor para com o nosso tempo, garantindo que a oportunidade esteja fortemente alinhada com o meu momento antes de seguirmos em frente.

Agradeço novamente o seu contato e fico no aguardo dos detalhes acima para seguirmos a nossa conversa. Um abraço!

## Outcomes

### Salary is at or below current
Congratulations! You collected a salary data-point. Maybe you’re getting paid about the right amount.

Thank them again for reaching out and let them know that you’re not currently open to offers less than ´$current * 1.5´

### Salary is less than 50% more than your current
It’s probably appropriate to have a think about how happy you are in your current role and how this offer might impact your long term career goals.
- Is the company more prestigious?
- Does it sound like something you’d like to do?
- Is the technology stack more interesting? More modern? Have better long-term-prospects?
This is in the range where IF the important things are there, you can think about chatting a little more. Don’t focus on the comp and set up a meeting with the manager.

If they ask you what you want to be paid before you’ve spoken to the hiring manager, tell them all the things you like about that role. What are the things that really have you on the fence? Then say something to the effect of:
> I've been thinking about the compensation question. Reasonably speaking there are way too many unknowns at this point in time for me to really have a sense for how much it would take for me to leave my current employer.

This is a really exciting sounding opportunity and I'm definitely intrigued, but I still think I'd need to know more before I gave an absolute number.
Factors like culture, tech stack, growth potential, and responsibilities will all play a pretty major role in what it would take to sell me on the job.
I'm happy to continue the conversation if they're willing to speak to me.

Don’t agree to a technical screening yet. That’s too much stress and not worth your time. At this point it’s reasonable to hop on that 15 minute call with the recruiter and arrange for a meet and greet with the hiring manager.

If you get through the chat with the manager, you’re probably safe to quote ´$current_salary * 1.5´. If you really like the role or feel like it is something that will help you achieve your long-term goals add in that you’d still like to keep talking but that’s a number you think is fair.

### If the pay represents a raise of 50% or greater
This is where you calmly reply “that sounds reasonable, let’s set up a time to talk.” Try not to giggle or do a happy dance while on the phone.

All of the advice around aligning your long term goals with compensation hold true. Don’t let your own dreams of swimming in a scrooge mcduck style swimming pool full of money cloud your vision. Don’t risk burnout, the market is hot, another offer is just around the corner.

At any time you can decide that you’d rather finish whatever project you’re attached to in your current role. Maybe you’ve got goals that are of interest to you.

## Why 50%
There have been a lot of articles complaining about the stress and effort involved in the tech hiring process. If companies are going to continue making you do weeks of studying alongside 10+ hours of interviews, all for a role that you might still not even get, they have to pay a premium for the time you’re working “on spec.”

Your skills and experience while in your current job have only increased since the last time you negotiated. If you’re in a job that you don’t hate, you’re bargaining from a position of strength. You’ve got the job and it is incumbent on the recruiter to convince you that theirs is good enough that you want to leave the one you’re at.

Do not discount the physical and emotional strain that doing an interview costs you. You might “pay” the interviewing company in vacation days, late nights, time spent studying when you just want to flomp on the couch with the latest Netflix. Everything that goes with an interview for nothing more than a promise of maybe?
It’d better be a really great promise! Otherwise just stick with the easy life.
This isn’t to say you can’t go for more, but 50% is in my opinion the minimum you should accept when all other things are considered equal. (You’re happy, respected, productive, etc…)
